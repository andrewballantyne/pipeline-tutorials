# OpenShift / Tekton Pipeline Tutorial

## Prerequisites

* Have `oc` installed
* Have `tkn` installed
* Have an active OpenShift cluster
* Have an understanding of the terminology

## Reason & Credits

These tutorial are created because I had issues with the [OpenShift Pipelines tutorial](https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial) and I felt the [Tekton Pipeline Hello World Tutorial](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md) didn't have enough meat for a full step by step tutorial.

I'll be combining information from both the [OpenShift Pipeline Tutorial Repo](https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial) and the [Tekton Pipeline](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) Repo, so credit to both of those repos and the contributors for providing different examples and sources of information for me to build these tutorials.

## Examples

* [Hello World](hello-world/README.md) - A simple introduction that does the initial programming example of printing out hello world.
